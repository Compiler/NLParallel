Albert Einstein (1879–1955) stated that "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality,
they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."

He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which
has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation"

Mass–energy equivalence arose originally from special relativity as a paradox described by Henri Poincaré.
